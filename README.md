# Simple Chat App

##### Summary:

Assigned to do a quick chat app within 2 hours.  Given the time constraints, many features we'd like in a chat app are missing of course.  I think I spent maybe three hours over 2 days on it, in between meetings and so on.  NodeJS with Primus for the websocket abstraction layer.  ReactJS/Redux in Coffeescript for the client.  


### Instructions:
- Assuming you have NodeJS, Npm, etc you will install Webpack `npm i -g webpack webpack-cli` and Nodemon `npm i -g nodemon`
- clone and `npm i`
- From directory `app_one` run the command `webpack -w`
- From directory `server` run `nodemon simple.coffee`
- Open a browser to port http://localhost:3003
- Try opening several browser windows to simulate different people.
